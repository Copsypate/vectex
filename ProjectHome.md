Its main goal is to be a robust texture plugin for rendering text, signs and any other type of vector art, without the need for an explicit conversion to a bitmap image. Correctly used it can both give a better quality and use less memory than a bitmap.

It is released as Free Software by using the GPL license. The included AGG and EXPAT libraries are licensed separately and retain their original copyrights.
